    <h2>👋 Hello {{ name }},</h2>

    <p>
      This is to inform you that your HR access on the HRMS platform has been
      revoked by an administrator.
    </p>

    <p>
      This change only affects your HR role and permissions. You still retain
      full access to your employee account, and there has been no impact on your
      employment or attendance records.
    </p>

    <h3>🧾 What This Means</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can no longer log in using HR credentials.</li>
      <li>All your HR sessions and OTPs have been deactivated.</li>
      <li>Your employee account remains unaffected.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: gray; font-style: italic;">
      If you believe this action was taken in error or you need clarification,
      please contact your administrator or HR team.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your service in the HR role.</p>

    <br />
    <p>— HRMS Admin Team</p>
